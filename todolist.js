// List of things that need to get done
// 1. Add black background & general font color to text, also wrap layout component in a constant main element?
// 2. Refactor Footer component (fix svg icon styling issues using classes), (refactor social icon list to maybe use a map function), (fix all styles to make sure they're working properly)
// 3. Refactor Header component into Nav component (pull Hero out of the header and into it's own component), (rename Header to Nav component, or just pull Nav out or whatever), (fix styling on the nav), (make the Nav follow down the page)
// 4. Refactor the new Hero component (make sure styles are working), (import in homepage file)
// 5. Pull old assets into this project (make svg components from SVG files), (make sure all files are connected properly), (refactor files using new gatsby image?)
